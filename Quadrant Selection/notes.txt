A common problem in mathematics is to determine which quadrant a given point lies in. There are four quadrants, numbered from 1 to 4, as shown in the diagram below:

For example, the point A, which is at coordinates (12,5) lies in quadrant 1 since both its x and y values are positive, and point B lies in quadrant 2 since its x value is negative and its yvalue is positive.

Your job is to take a point and determine the quadrant it is in. You can assume that neither of the two coordinates will be 0.
