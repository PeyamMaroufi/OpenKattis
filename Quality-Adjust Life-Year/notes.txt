The Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY) is a way to measure a personâ€™s quality of life that
includes both the quality and the quantity of life lived.
The quality of life lived can be quantified as a number between 0 and 1. If someone is living
with perfect health, the quality of life is 1. If someone is dead, then the quality of life is 0
The quality of life may increase or decrease due to medical treatements, sickness, etc.

The QALY for each period in which the quality of life is constant is simply the product of the
quality of life and the length of the period (in years). We wish to know the amount of QALY accumulated
by a person at the time of death, given the complete history of this person.
