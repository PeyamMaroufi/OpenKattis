The impossible has happened. Bear G. has fallen into his own trap. Lured by a delicious box of DomaÄ‡ica, without even thinking, he rushed and fell into his trap. In order to get out of the trap, he must solve the following task with your help. You are given three integers L, D and X

	* determine the minimal integer N such that L <= N <= D and the sum of its digits is X
	* determine the maximal integer M such that L <= M <= D and the sum of its digits is X

Bear will be able to escape from the trap if he correctly determines numbers N
and M. The numbers N and M will always exist.
