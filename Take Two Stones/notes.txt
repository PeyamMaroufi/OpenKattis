Alice and Bob are playing a new game of stones. There are N stones placed on the ground, forming a sequence.
The stones are labeled from 1 to N

Alice and Bob in turns take exactly two consecutive stones on the ground until there are no consecutive stones
on the ground. That is, each player can take stone i and stone i+1, where 1 <= i <= N−1. If the number of stone
left is odd, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

Assume both Alice and Bob play optimally and Alice plays first, do you know who the winner is?
